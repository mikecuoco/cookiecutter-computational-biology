# data

Raw data (reads, alignments, count matrix, etc) should be stored on separate file systems and linked to this directory for easy access.

Preprocessed and processed data that wll be used for multiple computational experiments should also be stored in this directory (try to keep < 1GB), with appropriate subdirectory nomenclature.

Fixed data sets should be stored here and organized chronologically in folders with YYYY-MM-DD format.
